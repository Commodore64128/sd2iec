# MCU to compile for
CONFIG_MCU=atmega644p

# Use the -relax parameter when linking?
# Passing -O9 and -relax to the linker saves ~650 bytes of flash,
# but the option is broken in certain binutils versions.
# (known troublemakers: binutils 2.17, 2.18 seems fine)
CONFIG_LINKER_RELAX=n

# MCU frequency in Hz - the fastloader code is hardcoded for 8MHz
CONFIG_MCU_FREQ=8000000

# Add a bootloader signature
CONFIG_BOOTLOADER=n

# Value of the signature word
CONFIG_BOOT_DEVID=0x49454321


# Enable UART debugging - requires 24 bytes plus buffer size in RAM
CONFIG_UART_DEBUG=n

# Baud rate of the UART, not used if CONFIG_UART_DEBUG is disabled

# log2 of the UART buffer size, i.e. 6 for 64, 7 for 128, 8 for 256 etc.

# Output a hex dump of all received commands via serial?
# Not used if CONFIG_UART_DEBUG is disabled.

# Enable Turbodisk soft fastloader support
# This option requires an external crystal oscillator!
CONFIG_TURBODISK=y


# Select which hardware to compile for
# Valid values:
#   1 - custom configuration in config.h
#   2 - Shadowolf MMC2IEC PCBs version 1.x
#   3 - original MMC2IEC
#   4 - uIEC
#   5 - Shadowolf sd2iec PCBs version 1.x
#   6 - NKC-modified MMC2IEC
CONFIG_HARDWARE_VARIANT=1

# The following SD settings are ignored on uIEC
# Support SDHC - disabling it saves ~220 bytes flash

# Number of retries if the SD communication fails
CONFIG_SD_AUTO_RETRIES=10

# Use CRC checks for all SD data transmissions?
CONFIG_SD_DATACRC=y

# Length of error message buffer - 1571 uses 36 bytes

# Length of command/filename buffer - 1571 uses 42 bytes
# The buffer is actually 2 bytes larger to simplify parsing.

# Number of sector buffers (256 byte+a bit of overhead)
#  In general: More buffers -> More open files at the same time
CONFIG_BUFFER_COUNT=3
