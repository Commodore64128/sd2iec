sd2iec - a controller/interface adapting SD/MMC to the CBM serial bus

This file needs to be expanded. A lot.

Compilation notes:
==================
sd2iec is set up to be compiled in multiple configurations, controlled by
variables supplied to the make command line.

The target chip must always be supplied by using either "make CHIP=m32"
for the ATmega32 or "make CHIP=m644" for the ATmega644.

By default the codes is configured for the I/O pin usage of the "Shadowwolf"
variant of the MMC2IEC board. If your circuit uses the original LarsP
circuit instead, add "LARSP=yes" to the make command line to change the
defaults. If you use a variant that is not covered by either of those options,
edit config.h yourself - the commented section is the one used by default.
