Introduction:
=============
sd2iec is a device for the Commodore serial bus that allows accessing an SD
or MMC card - think of it as a 1541 with a modern storage medium instead of
disks. The project was inspired by (and uses a few bits of code from)
MMC2IEC[1] by Lars Pontoppidan and runs on the same hardware.

Currently the compatibility is slightly higher than MMC2IEC 0.8, but there
are still lots of features missing. Anything that tries execute code on the
1541 will not work, this includes every software-fastloader.

Supported commands:
===================
- General notes:
  Wildcards are currently not supported.
  Filetypes and modes (e.g. ,S,W) are currently not supported.
  Directory filters are currently not supported.
  Any command not listed below is currently not supported.
  Long filenames are not supported.

  Subdirectory names in filenames are semi-supported, the syntax is not
  compatible to the CMD drives. The filenames are directly passed to the
  FAT library, so "/test/foo.bar" would access the file FOO.BAR in \TEST.

- CD/MD/RD:
  Subdirectory access is compatible to the syntax used by the CMD drives,
  although drive/partition numbers are completely ignored.

  Quick syntax overview:
    CD:_         changes into the parent dir (_ is the left arrow on the C64)
    CD:foo       changes into foo
    CD/foo       changes into foo
    CD:/foo      changes into foo
    CD://foo     changes into \foo
    CD//foo      changes into \foo
    CD/foo/:bar  changes into foo\bar, / before : is required
    CD/foo/bar   changes into foo\bar

    MD uses a syntax similiar to CD and will create the directory listed
    after the colon (:) relative to any directory listed before it.

    MD/foo/:bar  creates bar in foo
    MD//foo/:bar creates bar in \foo

    RD can only remove subdirectories of the current directory.

    RD:foo       deletes foo

- S:
  Only implemented in a "quick hack" version that doesn't support wildcards.

- UI+/UI-
  Switching the slightly faster bus protocol for the VC20 on and off works,
  it hasn't been tested much though.

- UI/UJ

Compilation notes:
==================
sd2iec is set up to be compiled in multiple configurations, controlled by
variables supplied to the make command line.

The target chip must always be supplied by using either "make CHIP=m32"
for the ATmega32 or "make CHIP=m644" for the ATmega644.

By default the codes is configured for the I/O pin usage of the "Shadowwolf"
variant of the MMC2IEC board. If your circuit uses the original LarsP
circuit instead, add "LARSP=yes" to the make command line to change the
defaults. If you use a variant that is not covered by either of those options,
edit config.h yourself - the commented section is the one used by default.
